# pandas-challenge
This repo contains a Jupyter notebook file that analyzes the PyCitySchools homework. This project analyzes a set of school district data, incluing student scores, school budgets, and school sizes, based on the district as a whole, individual schools and students, and different types of schools. For example, one section involves analyzing student passing rates at each school based on the number of students attending that school.

### Prerequisites

CSV files `schools_complete.csv` and `students_complete.csv` can be found in the `Resources` folder and are required for the notebook to run properly. All output will occur in Jupyter, which can be run in an Anaconda.

### Built With
Python (Jupyter, Pandas)
